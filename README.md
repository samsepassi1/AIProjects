This Python script performs the following tasks:

Purpose
The script automates the process of fetching, analyzing, and reporting threat intelligence data from AlienVault's OTX API, with daily email delivery of a PDF report. It integrates multiple functionalities such as data fetching, visualization, PDF generation, and email automation.

Core Features
Fetching Threat Data

Uses the OTX API to fetch subscribed threat pulses (pulses/subscribed endpoint).
The data includes details like pulse ID, name, author, tags, timestamps, and descriptions.
Data Processing

Converts the raw JSON response from the API into a Pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.
Formats and cleans the data by extracting relevant columns and formatting timestamps.
Visualizations

Bar Chart: Displays the frequency of threat pulses created by different authors.
Pie Chart: Highlights the top 5 most common tags in the threat data.
PDF Report Generation

Creates a PDF report with:
A title page.
Bar chart and pie chart sections.
Dedicated pages for each threat pulse, showing details like ID, name, author, tags, and description.
Email Automation

Sends the generated PDF report as an email attachment using the SMTP protocol.
Includes a plain-text email body and dynamically attaches the PDF.
Daily Automation

Uses the APScheduler library to schedule the script to run daily at 4:00 PM.
Detailed Workflow
Data Fetching:

The fetch_data function retrieves the threat data using the OTX API and handles errors (e.g., connectivity issues or invalid API keys).
Report Generation:

Processes the fetched data into meaningful insights:
Creates visualizations (bar chart and pie chart).
Compiles all data into a multi-page PDF report with summaries and individual pulse details.
Email Sending:

Uses Python's smtplib library to send the report via email.
Authenticates with the SMTP server (e.g., Gmail) and attaches the PDF.
Scheduler:

The BlockingScheduler schedules the main function to run daily at 4:00 PM.
The scheduler ensures the script runs continuously in the background.
Potential Use Cases
Automating threat intelligence monitoring for cybersecurity teams.
Generating and sharing periodic reports for internal analysis or stakeholders.
Learning and applying API integrations, data visualization, and Python programming in practical scenarios.
How It Runs
One-Time Setup: Set API key, email credentials, and recipient email.
Daily Automation: The script fetches new data, processes it, generates a PDF, and sends it via email at 4:00 PM daily.
Error Logging: Provides detailed error logs for issues like missing data, SMTP authentication failures, or API connectivity problems.
This script is an excellent example of integrating multiple technologies (APIs, data visualization, PDF generation, and automation) into a cohesive solution for real-world applications.
